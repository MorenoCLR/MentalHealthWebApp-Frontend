Hi — I need your help running two quick changes in our Supabase project so sign-up/login (email confirm, OTP, reset) work reliably.

Please run these two SQL scripts in Supabase → SQL Editor (paste + Run each script in order). The files are in the repo at:
- db/migrations/0001_create_users_and_trigger.sql
- db/migrations/0002_enable_rls_and_policies.sql

After running them, please update Auth settings:
- Site URL: set to our app URL (e.g., https://our-app.example.com)
- Add Redirect URL: https://our-app.example.com/auth/confirm
- Configure SMTP / Email provider so confirmation/reset emails are delivered

Verification steps:
1. Confirm `public.users` exists in Database -> Table Editor
2. Sign up via the app and click the confirmation link from email
3. Return to app and try login (password/OTP/reset)

If anything fails, send me the error or the confirmation/reset link (you can redact tokens). Thanks — much appreciated!
